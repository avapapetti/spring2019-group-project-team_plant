Plant Quiz
=========


This is an interactive quiz that allows you to figure out which house plant best suits your lifestyle and wishes!


Description
===========

Have you ever found yourself on Mother's Day frantically googling which plant is best for your mom, even though your mom is not like most moms out there?? Or are you a college student wishing you could buy a small plant that can survive your windowless dorm room and lack of attention? Or do you just need a really beautiful flowering plant to make your neighbors jealous when they come over for dinner this Thursday?

Look no further! This is the plant quiz to stop your frantic googling and worrying! We will ask you questions, and all you have to do is answer them truthfully! We will give you your top 5 results out of 134 popular house plants based on your answers, and then you have the option to find out more about them (we hope you will!).
